<h2>Journal Entry #1</h2>
<h3>Subaru Crosstrek</h3>
<em>Alexander Baron<em></em> <br> 03-14-25<br><br>

  When I am driving my Subaru Crosstrek 2021, I noticed something unusual - when I come to a stop, such as at a traffic light, the engine would turn off automatically. At first, this made me anxious, I thought the car might have malfunctioned. Then, as I took my foot off the brake, the engine turned back on. A small green icon appeared on the dashboard whenever the engine shut off, and it disappeared when the engine restarted. Curious and confused, I scanned the dashboard and the surrounding areas to figure out what was going on. To the left of the steering wheel, I noticed a button with the same icon that had appeared on the dashboard circular arrow with an "A" in the middle. Pressing it caused the engine to start back up instantly, even though the car hadn't moved.

  After some trial and error and a bit of online searching, I discovered the Auto Stop-Start feature, designed to save fuel and reduce emissions by turning off the engine while the vehicle is idle. I found the sudden silence and restart distracting, especially in stop-and-go traffic, so I decided to turn it off regularly using the button

  At first I was very confused why this happened. I found out that there was a feature in the Crosstrek that turns the car off to save fuel or something. I've learned to turn it off by pressing a button to the left of the wheel. I've sort of created a **mental model**, where I can just turn it off without having to search for the button. It's cool because when I do successfully hit the button, the engine turns back on, so I am getting **feedback** telling me whether or not I pressed the right button.
