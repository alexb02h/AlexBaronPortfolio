<h2>Journal Entry #1</h2>
Subaru Crosstrek<br><br>
*Alexander Baron* <br> 03-14-25<br><br>


  When I am driving my Subaru Crosstrek 2021, and I come to a stop, the car turns off on its own. At first I was very confused why this happened. I found out that there was a feature in the Crosstrek that turns the car off to save fuel 
or something. Ive learned to turn it off by pressing a button to the left of the wheel, Ive sort of created a **mental model**,
where I can just turn it off without having to search for the button. Its cool because when I do successfully hit the 
button the engine turns back on so I am getting **feedback** telling me wether or not I pressed the right button.
